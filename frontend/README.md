# BragNFT Frontend

This is a vanilla HTML/JS interface for interacting with the BragNFT ecosystem.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured with a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) that automatically handles deployment for you.

1. Push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. The Action will compile your contracts, update the ABIs, and push the site to a `gh-pages` branch.
3. In your GitHub Repo settings, under **Pages**, ensure the source is set to **Deploy from a branch** and the branch is set to **gh-pages**.

## Local Development

The frontend is a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. To run it locally, use a local server to avoid CORS issues with template fetching:
```bash
npm run serve
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Dual-State Architecture (Nexus)

The frontend implements conditional rendering for the **Nexus Dual-State** model:
*   **Discovery:** Shows all minted NFTs in the gallery.
*   **Product View:** Automatically detects if the connected wallet is the `originalDonor`. If so, it reveals the **Tax Record** section and enables the **Export Tax Bundle (PDF)** feature.
*   **Vitality Glow:** Displays a visual neon-glow effect on the NFT if it has been "topped up" within the last 30 days.

## Viewing NFTs

The SPA uses hash-based routing with query parameters for deep linking.

**URL Template:**
`#/product?id=<TOKEN_ID>&addr=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`

**Example:**
`#/product?id=0&addr=0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9`

### Triggering Live Data
To see real data in the gallery and product page:
1.  Open the **Manager** view and connect your wallet.
2.  In the **Donate & Mint** section, enter a donation amount and impact message.
3.  Once the transaction confirms, the NFT will appear in the **Marketplace** discovery gallery.

### Media Support
The frontend supports a wide range of media types:
*   **On-Chain SVG:** Generated dynamically for message-based donations.
*   **Images:** JPG, PNG, WEBP, and animated GIFs.
*   **Multimedia:** MP3/WAV/OGG audio and MP4/WebM video support.
*   **Gateways:** Automatic resolution for `ipfs://` and `ar://` (Arweave) URIs via public gateways.
